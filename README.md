## My process
- Utilized various *flexbox* properties to achieve the desired responsiveness and to match the design spec
- Used a *container* class to set the max-width of the different sections, allowing for full-width backgrounds
- Used a mobile-first approach to writing CSS
- Used *CSS Grid* within the *footer* to achieve the desired layout
- Adjusted *flexbox* and *CSS Grid* properties within media queries to adapt the website to larger device sizes
 

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox

- Mobile-first approach to CSS


### What I learned
- How to approach a larger project with unique sections on a single page
- Practiced writing HTML that logically separates the different sections on the page and utilizes classes (*container*) to share behavior between different sections
- Continued practice with writing mobile-first CSS
- Adjusting *flexbox* and *CSS Grid* properties for larger device sizes to match the provided design spec
